Getting Started with Python
===========================

Welcome to Python! Not only are you entering the new world of a programming language, but you are also entering an *ecosystem* of professional and hobbyist developers from literally every corner of the globe coming together to make the world a better place through software (and make a little bit of money at the same time)!

Of course, that last part is optional — you are totally free to code Python on your own and chose not to interact with anyone within the community — but, you'll be missing out on the best part of what makes Python Python!
