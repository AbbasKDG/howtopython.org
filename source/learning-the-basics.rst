Learning the Basics
===================

We've already covered that Python is more about the people than it is about the code. So, let's learn a bit about the organizations and processes these people participate in.


The Python Software Foundation
------------------------------

The Python Software Foundation is a non–profit organization that is responsible for holding and protecting the intellectual property of Python, the Package Index, PyCon, and related. It heavily contributes towards the sustainability of the language and its ecosystem both financially and through infrastructure. 


PEPs
----

PEPs (Python Enhncement Proposals) are the documents/process through which Python gets enhanced and changed, over time. The most infamous PEP is `PEP8 <http://pep8.org/>`_, which documents how to properly style Python code within the community. 

Anyone can propose a PEP, even you! It's a long process, for good reasons — you have to convince a lot of people that your idea is a good one.
