Text Editors
============

Writing Python code typically involves what it known as a Text Editor. Our recommendation for a text editor is either `Sublime Text 3 <https://www.sublimetext.com/3>`_, which costs money but is free to use, or `Microsoft VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com>`_.

The functional difference between these two editors is small — they both accomplish the same things, effectively. Which one you chose is a matter of personal taste. There are other editors, like *vim*, *Atom*, or *emacs*, which you may chose to use instead. Whatever works best for you is best. 

I personally use an vastly prefer *Sublime Text 3* to all other options available. It's easily my favorite editor. If it didn't exist though, I'd be using *VS Code*.

Python Requirements for a Text Editor
-------------------------------------

There are a few soft "requirements" for a text editors

- Support for "soft tabs"
- Support for visible whitespace (this is crucial when working with Python files)

Nice–to–haves:

- Support for "rulers", which show a horizontal line at line 79, as PEP8 recommends. 
- Built-in linter for showing sytax errors as you type. 
- Built-in support for Flake8, which enforces PEP8 standards as you type. 


Sublime Text 3
--------------

Sublime Text doesn't support all of these things by itself, but it comes with a great system called *Package Control*, which allows for easy installation/management of third-party plugins.

Microsoft VS Code guides you through setting up the Python package, built by Microsoft themselves, the first time you run it.
